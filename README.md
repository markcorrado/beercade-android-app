# beercade-android-app
This is an Android app to keep track of high scores at Beercade in Omaha, NE.

There is a list of the high scores and you can click the add button on the bottom right.  If you take a picture of the screen after you achieve your high score and fill out the required information and press "Submit", An email to the establishment will be pre-filled out for you and the admin will update the database when they verify the score!

Technical side:
I am using Parse as a backend. If you pull down the code, you should have an error regarding Parse-UI. Since as of now, the Parse-UI library is not open-source, you have to pull down their library and add it as a module to the project.
