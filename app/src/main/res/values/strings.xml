    <string name="faq">
        What are your age restrictions?
        \n\nBeercade is a BAR with arcade games.
        \nOur establishment is 21 and over. We do allow minors accompanied by a parent until 7 pm everyday. Please remember that this is an adult environment, which should be considered before bringing children.
        \nMy friends are 21, can I come with them?
        \nSorry, not without your parent.
